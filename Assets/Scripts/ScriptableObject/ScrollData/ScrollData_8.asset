  title: Algorithms and Complexities
  content: 'This focuses on analyzing iterative and recursive algorithms for use
    of resources (time, memory, parallelism, bandwidth, randomness, etc.). Develop
    fluency with big-O notation, and learn to choose and implement efficient algorithms
    for numeric, combinatorial, and geometric problems. Learn basic concepts and
    terminology in computability and computational complexity.
